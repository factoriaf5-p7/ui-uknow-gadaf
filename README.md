## U-KNOW platform

The platform has a **Home page** where the courses are filtered by **category**, **popularity** and **topic**. There is also a list of all the courses ordered by ranking, with a **search bar** in real time. 

In the **New course** section, the user can create their own course by filling in the fields provided. The courses have an initial price of 100 knowlitos. Once created, they will automatically appear in the **My courses** section, divided between **Created courses** and **Bought courses**. By signing up, the user automatically gets **1000 Knowlitos**, with which they can start buying and consuming courses. The user's **wallet** is automatically updated with each of these interactions.

Each course has its individual page with its information. If the user has purchased or created the course, they can view the full content and click the links. If not, the content is protected and the user is prompted to purchase the course.

Finally, there is a **Profile** section in which you can modify the profile data, log out, check the wallet data, and other functionalities.
 
The website has a responsive navigation bar, and a dropdown menu in the Profile item that detects whether the user is connected or not.
